# React Native with Redux and Firebase boilerplate

As the name says by itself it's a boilerplate for React Native thar I built with initial configs. I use it to start my projects but feel free to use yourself.

## Initializing

First be sure the substitute all "com.reactnativereduxboilerplate" bundles for the you you'll be using before build.

Second, create your google-services.json (for Android) or a GoogleService-Info.plist (for iOS) inside a firebase project.
